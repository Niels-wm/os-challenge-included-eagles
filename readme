The idea of having multiple different tasks, originates from the difference between the cursor moving across your screen, vs downloading the nth packet of a huge download. So in order to take care of the queing, i open all the packets as they arrive. The file descriptor and the packet is then moved into a linked list based on their priority. The main thread, then creates threads, that will take out the top of this que.



####Setup

As the older commits is not reliable on my machine(connection reset by peer). I havent been able to test against something that does not have priority queing. Therefore setup is kind of obsolete.

####Conclusion
I dont really have any, as i have no tests. I can only say, that i think this would have been faster.
